The legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
â€¦ But she said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this"
